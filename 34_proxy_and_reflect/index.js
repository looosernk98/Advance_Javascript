/*
 A Proxy object wraps another object and intercepts operations, like reading/writing 
 properties and others, optionally handling them on its own, or transparently 
 allowing the object to handle them.

 Reflect is a built-in object that simplifies creation of Proxy.
 The Reflect object makes that somewhat possible. Its methods are minimal 
 wrappers around the internal methods.
