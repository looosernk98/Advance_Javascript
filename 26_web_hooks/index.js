/*
 A webhook is a way for one application to send real-time data to another 
 application when an event occurs. It is a mechanism for "pushing" data from one 
 service to another without polling or continuous requests.

 How it works:
 1. Event-Based Triggering: A webhook is triggered by an event in the source 
        application, like a new user signing up, a purchase, or a status update.

 2. HTTP Request: When the event occurs, the source application sends an HTTP 
       POST request to a preconfigured URL in the destination application. 
       This request contains data related to the event, typically in JSON format.

 3. Real-Time Communication: The destination application can use the data 
       immediately to trigger actions or updates, offering a real-time way to 
       integrate and synchronize data across different systems.

Example of using webhook:
Let’s say you want to integrate a payment platform (like Stripe) with your own 
application to notify it whenever a payment is completed. You’d configure a 
webhook on Stripe to send data to your application whenever a payment succeeds, 
allowing you to automatically update your database, send a confirmation email, 
or perform other actions based on the event.

Webhook Use Cases:
1. Payment Processing: Notifying an e-commerce site when a payment is confirmed.
2. Data Sync: Syncing customer data between a CRM and an email marketing platform.
3. Notifications: Sending real-time alerts when specific actions occur 
                 (e.g., a new signup or error log).
4. Automation: Triggering workflows in response to specific actions, such as 
               creating a ticket in a support system when an issue is reported.
